Next n entries with string length, lower and upper bounds (15 0.0 10.0)
If niching in constraint handling is desired (y/n)
If report.out file with population record is to be printed (y/n)
How many runs (1)
Crossover probability (0.6-1.0)
Mutation probability (1/string length)
Seed for the random number generator (0.0-1.0)
