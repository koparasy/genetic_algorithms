Maximum generation number (100)
Population size (usually 10*number of variables)
Number of binary-coded variables (n_b)
Number of real-coded variables (n_r)
Next n_b entries with string length, lower and upper bounds (15 0.0 10.0)
Next n_r entries with lower and upper bounds (0.0 10.0)
Are these bounds must be followed (y/n)
If niching in constraint handling is desired (y/n)
If report.out file with population record is to be printed (y/n)
How many runs (1)
Crossover probability (0.6-1.0)
Mutation probablity for binary-coded variables (1/string length)
Mutation probability for real-coded variables (1/n)
SBX and polynomial mutation parameters for real-coded variables (2 100)
Seed for the random number generator (0.0-1.0)
